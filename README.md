Rules of the game    
-----     
This is a two player game. Players turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Here instead of discs, we use '*' for player 1 and '-' for player 2.
